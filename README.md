# Neural Mechanisms Underlying Memory Encoding and Retrieval

## Overview
Memory reactivation is a critical neuro-cognitive process enabling the reconstruction of past experiences. This project investigates the neural mechanisms underlying memory encoding and retrieval, particularly focusing on naturalistic scenes. Utilizing functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), we examined the brain regions activated during these phases and analyzed the differences in neural activity patterns.

## Features
- Converts DICOM files to NIFTI format.
- Processes data using ezBIDS for faster processing.
- Organizes ezBIDS folders.
- Automates fMRIPrep processing.
- Performs group GLM analysis.
- Retrieves statistical measures from the analysis.

## Data and Code Sharing

### Data
The raw data cannot be shared due to privacy concerns, and subject IDs are left blank. Individual GLM analyses (glm_1) are also not currently available. We provide code for the FPR-corrected group GLM analysis related to Animacy, with directory path names replaced with placeholders.

### Code
The code shared is limited to non-sensitive parts.
